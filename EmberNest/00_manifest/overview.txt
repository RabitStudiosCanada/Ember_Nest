📜 :: MANIFESTO

> You are not just building a camper.
> You are building a vessel for fire.

**EmberNest** is a covenant between engineering and myth.
It is a modular, climate-adaptive shelter designed to move **between extremes**:
the frost-thick woods of the north, and the sun-flaked stone of the desert.

But more than steel and insulation, it is built of **intent**.

This project carries symbolic obligations:
- To make space sacred.
- To treat sustainability not as a checkbox, but as a **ritual**.
- To welcome the strange, the poetic, and the unnecessary—as **vital**.

🌀 :: CORE PILLARS

1. **ADAPTABILITY** — The shell and systems change with the land.
2. **OPENNESS** — All files, blueprints, and glyphs are public and remixable.
3. **MEANING** — The EmberNest must never forget *why* it was made.
4. **BEAUTY** — Even in frost. Especially in dust.
5. **BIOME-AFFINITY** — Each rig becomes part of the place it rests in.

🔣 :: SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS

- **Glyph Skins** — Responsive vinyl overlays that change based on heat, sun, or touch
- **Memory Wall** — A finger-drawn panel for ritual or journaling
- **Thermal Core** — A fireless hearth. The flame inside is **inferred**, not lit.
- **Ritual Drawer** — Optional module for storing meaning, not tools
- **Build Blessing** — You are encouraged to name your EmberNest. It has a soul.

🛡️ :: GUARDIAN CLAUSE

> If you build EmberNest, you become a Guardian of the Flame.

This does not mean you must chant.
It means you must **not strip** the meaning out of the bones.
If you wish to build a van, there are better blueprints.
If you wish to build a **home that *listens***—
You’re in the right folder.
