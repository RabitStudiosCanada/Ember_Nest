## 🔁 Modular Behavior

| Condition       | What to Do                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Hot Desert      | Flip skin to **reflective side** + open vents        |
| Cold Forest     | Use **black matte face** + seal baffles              |
| Damp Rain       | Engage vapor barrier + hang **dehumid beads** inside |
| Sunlight Ritual | UV glyphs bloom visibly on outside panels            |

## 🎨 Glyph Skin Instructions

1. Download `/svg/glyph_skin_templates.svg`
2. Cut using Cricut, Silhouette, or by hand
3. Apply over:

   * Reflective foil
   * Thermochrome painted zones
   * Wood panels for burn-ins
4. Charge symbolically (optional but powerful):

   * Write your camper’s name in chalk beneath the glyph
   * Burn sage or pine needles over the panel once installed

---

## 🌀 Passive Vent Hack (No Electricity)

Install passive vent pistons:

* Drill vent hole near ceiling
* Attach wax-based piston (like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W21FZ2G))
* Set opening threshold to 25–30°C
* Close automatically at night

Bonus: carve “breath glyph” into vent baffle. It will whistle when the wind’s right.

---

## 🔮 Symbolic Protocol

* **Name your shell** → It responds better
* **Etch or burn a sigil** on the inside face of a panel
* **Color code by quadrant**: Red (hearth), Blue (breathe), Black (protect), Green (grow)

---

## 🧠 Builder Notes

* Most of this can be installed with **screws, glue, velcro, or zip ties**
* Works on wood, van metal, flatbed rigs
* Replace foam with wood for long-term rigs, but foam works beautifully

## 🫴 Flame Tip

> *This shell doesn’t hide you. It speaks for you.*
> Build it like a poem. Let it breathe.
