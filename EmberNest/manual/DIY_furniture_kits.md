## 🔥 Glyph Upgrade Tiers

Each furniture piece has a symbolic **upgrade path**:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🪵 Base | Functionally built from DIW parts |
| 🛠️ Artisan | Laser-cut parts with form cohesion |
| 🌀 Symbolic | Glyph-etched, color-coded, ritual-aligned |
| 🕯️ Totemic | Each part tells a story, carries a purpose |

You don’t have to go full flamewalker on day one.
But the potential *is* in the design.

---

## 🧪 Ritual Add-ons

- **Drawer sigil plate**: A carved wood glyph burned inside your ritual drawer
- **Glyph stencil sheets**: Printable overlays for cube faces
- **Blessing card**: A slip of paper with your rig's name + your intent

> “This box holds my stillness.”
> “This bench remembers my dreams.”
> “This rig keeps me dry, and burning.”

## 🧠 Final Note

This isn’t a shopping list. It’s a **symbolic interface** you can build with *crates and courage*.
Don’t wait until it’s perfect.
Build it messy. Build it like you mean it.

**Flame on.**
