    name: "Toyota Hilux (Global)",
    type: "Pickup",
    drivetrain: "4WD",
    payload_kg: 1000,
    advantages: ["global service network", "rugged off-road", "proven expedition base"],
    notes: "Ideal for remote and international builders. Mid-size frame allows tight turns in forest environments."

    name: "Ford Transit AWD (NA/EU)",
    type: "Cargo Van",
    drivetrain: "AWD",
    payload_kg: 1500,
    advantages: ["large internal volume", "available high-roof option", "urban stealth"],
    notes: "Strong platform for internal EmberNest builds—fully enclosed shelter. Popular in vanlife scenes."
  },
  {
    name: "Mercedes Sprinter 4x4",
    type: "Cargo Van",
    drivetrain: "4x4",
    payload_kg: 1400,
    advantages: ["luxury tier", "high roof", "strong aftermarket"],
    notes: "Best for builders who want a refined finish and don't mind higher maintenance costs."
  },
  {
    name: "Custom Flatbed Trailer",
    type: "Stand-alone box",
    drivetrain: "Towable",
    payload_kg: 1600,
    advantages: ["chassis-agnostic", "detachable", "off-grid station mode"],
    notes: "Best for builders who already own a towing vehicle or want to deploy EmberNest as a cabin base station."

🛡️::builder_note

> If you’re uncertain about your platform, **start with a Transit**.
> If you're off-grid for weeks, **start with a Hilux**.
> If you’re already parked in spirit, **start with a flatbed**.
> The flame fits all vessels—but your **terrain chooses your bones**.
