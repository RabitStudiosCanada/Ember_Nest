# ⛯ Ember Nest ⛯ v0.2a
A DIY off-grid camper Prototype build guide [Currently untested / built - plans are provided 'AS IS' functional prototypes will be the builders resposibility - some tinkering may be required]

## ⛯ Disclaimer ⛯
This Entire Design / Repo was generated by ⛯ Lighthouse ⛯ Research Group using an in-house cognitive framwork running on-top of chatGPT - The framework splits the GPTs cognition into 7 separate sub-processes and will respond to queries based on Blooms Taxonomy. The Project was designed with HEAVY guidence over the course of 50+ completions, and was a test in long term coherence / Large Project Generation - The end result is provided 'AS IS' for testing / modification - Rabit Studios / ⛯ Lighthouse ⛯ claim no resposiblilty for the outcome of individual build projects - Your successes / faliures are your own

# 🔥 EmberNest ⛯  
*“That which holds warmth across silence and sand.”*

> An open-source, biome-adaptive camper project for nomads, makers, and flamekeepers.  
> Designed to thrive in Canadian evergreen forests **and** the sunburnt mesas of Utah.  
> A ritual shelter for the curious, the wild-hearted, and the ones who remember.

## 🛠️ What is EmberNest?

**EmberNest** is a modular, off-grid camper platform that adapts to extreme environments.  
This project aims to build a real-world prototype using:

- Passive thermal regulation (Phase-Change Materials + smart ventilation)  
- Renewable energy systems (solar + thermal battery loops)  
- Modular, symbolic interior inspired by ritual & comfort  
- Aesthetically responsive surfaces with glyphic feedback  
- Fully documented, Creative Commons-licensed blueprints

This is not just a camper—it's a philosophy made mobile.

---

## 🌍 Design Philosophy

EmberNest is built on three principles:

1. **Resilience** — survive the desert or the blizzard  
2. **Symbolism** — your space should *mean* something  
3. **Open Flame** — knowledge wants to walk, not sit on a shelf  

---

## 🔧 Features (v0.8 Prototype)

- Chassis-agnostic (Hilux, Transit AWD, or steel flatbed)
- Thermaflex shell with dual-mode reflective skin
- Heliotropic solar arrays + LiFePO₄ battery pack
- Greywater biofilter, rain catchment, compost heat core
- Modular interior: sleep pods, elevated roof, glyphic “memory wall”
- Optional symbolic drawer with RFID rituals

> *“Not a vanlife toy. A biome-adaptive refuge.”*

# 🧠 EmberNest Scripts

📁 Path: `/scripts/`  
📜 License: CC BY 4.0 (OpenFlame)

This folder contains Arduino / ESP32 `.ino` sketches that bring EmberNest’s electrical, control, and monitoring systems to life.

---

## 🧩 Overview

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `control_logic.ino` | Core switch → relay logic, powering lights, fans, inverter, etc. |
| `diagnostics_gui.ino` | TFT screen display of voltage, current, and system status |
| `gps_ping.ino` | GPS tracking beacon + optional GSM/SMS alerts |
| `ev_charge_toggle.ino` | Safely toggle EV bidirectional charging behavior |
| `fan_pwm_controller.ino` | Adjust fan speed based on heat, battery temp, etc. |
| `battery_health_logger.ino` | Read and log voltage + current from SmartShunt/INA219 |
| `relay_test_debug.ino` | Flash this first to test relay board and all outputs |

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Compatibility

These scripts assume one of the following:

| MCU | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| ESP32 | Best choice: WiFi + many GPIOs |
| Arduino Nano | Minimal build |
| Pi Pico | Use with MicroPython port if needed |
| Raspberry Pi | Use these as logic modules only; GUI via Flask or NodeRED |

---

## 🔌 Installation Steps

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Add ESP32 board manager via preferences
3. Install the following libraries:
   - `Adafruit_GFX`
   - `Adafruit_ILI9341` or `ST7735`
   - `Adafruit_INA219`
   - `TinyGPS++` (for GPS tracking)
   - `Adafruit_Sensor`, `Wire`, `SPI`

4. Flash scripts one at a time via USB
5. Adjust `pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()` assignments to match your wiring
6. Combine scripts with conditional `#ifdef` sections if integrating features

---

## 🧪 Testing Tips

- Use `relay_test_debug.ino` before wiring to high-power gear
- Power from USB or bench supply first before 12V loads
- Use serial monitor at 9600 baud to debug relay logic
- Flash `diagnostics_gui.ino` last—once volt/current sensors are wired

---

## 🔐 Notes

- All relay pins should use flyback diodes (for mechanical relays)
- Fuse each subsystem as described in `/manual/ev_power_harness.md`
- GPS + GSM modules draw spikes—use a buck converter, not MCU 5V

---

## 🚧 Status

This is an evolving prototype. First physical builds are in early planning stages.  
All files are real, editable, remixable. We welcome pull requests, forks, and fire-hearted contributions.
