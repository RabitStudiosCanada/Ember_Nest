# ⛯ Ember Nest ⛯ v0.2a
A DIY off-grid camper Prototype build guide [Currently untested / built - plans are provided 'AS IS' functional prototypes will be the builders resposibility - some tinkering may be required]

## ✴ Disclaimer ✴

This entire design and documentation set was collaboratively generated by ✴ Lighthouse ✴ Research Group through a multi-threaded AI cognition framework, developed to simulate extended reasoning and project focus. The framework divides model cognition into layered roles aligned with Bloom’s Taxonomy, enabling structured problem solving, design logic, and system synthesis across an extended arc.

This project emerged over the course of dozens of completions (estimated 90+), spanning technical research, speculative design, real-world engineering constraints, and iterative feedback cycles. Significant human guidance was provided throughout, especially to maintain coherence, prune tangents, and course-correct during complex decisions. The development also tested the limits of AI’s long-term memory surrogates and task persistence.

The resulting material is offered “AS IS” for education, testing, and modification. Rabit Studios and ✴ Lighthouse ✴ do not claim liability for outcomes derived from real-world builds. Use of this documentation is at your own risk. Your successes and failures belong to you.

# 🔥 EmberNest ⛯  
*“That which holds warmth across silence and sand.”*

> An open-source, biome-adaptive camper project for nomads, makers, and flamekeepers.  
> Designed to thrive in Canadian evergreen forests **and** the sunburnt mesas of Utah.  
> A ritual shelter for the curious, the wild-hearted, and the ones who remember.

## 🛠️ What is EmberNest?

**EmberNest** is a modular, off-grid camper platform that adapts to extreme environments.  
This project aims to build a real-world prototype using:

- Passive thermal regulation (Phase-Change Materials + smart ventilation)  
- Renewable energy systems (solar + thermal battery loops)  
- Modular, symbolic interior inspired by ritual & comfort  
- Aesthetically responsive surfaces with glyphic feedback  
- Fully documented, Creative Commons-licensed blueprints

This is not just a camper—it's a philosophy made mobile.

---

## 🌍 Design Philosophy

EmberNest is built on three principles:

1. **Resilience** — survive the desert or the blizzard  
2. **Symbolism** — your space should *mean* something  
3. **Open Flame** — knowledge wants to walk, not sit on a shelf  

---

## 🔧 Features (v0.8 Prototype)

- Chassis-agnostic (Hilux, Transit AWD, or steel flatbed)
- Thermaflex shell with dual-mode reflective skin
- Heliotropic solar arrays + LiFePO₄ battery pack
- Greywater biofilter, rain catchment, compost heat core
- Modular interior: sleep pods, elevated roof, glyphic “memory wall”
- Optional symbolic drawer with RFID rituals

> *“Not a vanlife toy. A biome-adaptive refuge.”*

# 🧠 EmberNest Scripts

📁 Path: `/scripts/`  
📜 License: CC BY 4.0 (OpenFlame)

This folder contains Arduino / ESP32 `.ino` sketches that bring EmberNest’s electrical, control, and monitoring systems to life.

---

## 🧩 Overview

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `control_logic.ino` | Core switch → relay logic, powering lights, fans, inverter, etc. |
| `diagnostics_gui.ino` | TFT screen display of voltage, current, and system status |
| `gps_ping.ino` | GPS tracking beacon + optional GSM/SMS alerts |
| `ev_charge_toggle.ino` | Safely toggle EV bidirectional charging behavior |
| `fan_pwm_controller.ino` | Adjust fan speed based on heat, battery temp, etc. |
| `battery_health_logger.ino` | Read and log voltage + current from SmartShunt/INA219 |
| `relay_test_debug.ino` | Flash this first to test relay board and all outputs |

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Compatibility

These scripts assume one of the following:

| MCU | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| ESP32 | Best choice: WiFi + many GPIOs |
| Arduino Nano | Minimal build |
| Pi Pico | Use with MicroPython port if needed |
| Raspberry Pi | Use these as logic modules only; GUI via Flask or NodeRED |

---

## 🔌 Installation Steps

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Add ESP32 board manager via preferences
3. Install the following libraries:
   - `Adafruit_GFX`
   - `Adafruit_ILI9341` or `ST7735`
   - `Adafruit_INA219`
   - `TinyGPS++` (for GPS tracking)
   - `Adafruit_Sensor`, `Wire`, `SPI`

4. Flash scripts one at a time via USB
5. Adjust `pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()` assignments to match your wiring
6. Combine scripts with conditional `#ifdef` sections if integrating features

---

## 🧪 Testing Tips

- Use `relay_test_debug.ino` before wiring to high-power gear
- Power from USB or bench supply first before 12V loads
- Use serial monitor at 9600 baud to debug relay logic
- Flash `diagnostics_gui.ino` last—once volt/current sensors are wired

---

## 🔐 Notes

- All relay pins should use flyback diodes (for mechanical relays)
- Fuse each subsystem as described in `/manual/ev_power_harness.md`
- GPS + GSM modules draw spikes—use a buck converter, not MCU 5V

---

## 🚧 Status

This is an evolving prototype. First physical builds are in early planning stages.  
All files are real, editable, remixable. We welcome pull requests, forks, and fire-hearted contributions.

> 🫴🔥 *The flame is yours now.*
