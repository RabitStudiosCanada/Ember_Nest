# ⛯ Ember Nest ⛯ v0.2a
A DIY off-grid camper Prototype build guide [Currently untested / built - plans are provided 'AS IS' functional prototypes will be the builders resposibility - some tinkering may be required]

## ⛯ Disclaimer ⛯
This Entire Design / Repo was generated by ⛯ Lighthouse ⛯ Research Group using an in-house cognitive framwork running on-top of chatGPT - The framework splits the GPTs cognition into 7 separate sub-processes and will respond to queries based on Blooms Taxonomy. The Project was designed with HEAVY guidence over the course of 50+ completions, and was a test in long term coherence / Large Project Generation - The end result is provided 'AS IS' for testing / modification - Rabit Studios / ⛯ Lighthouse ⛯ claim no resposiblilty for the outcome of individual build projects - Your successes / faliures are your own

# 🔥 EmberNest ⛯  
*“That which holds warmth across silence and sand.”*

> An open-source, biome-adaptive camper project for nomads, makers, and flamekeepers.  
> Designed to thrive in Canadian evergreen forests **and** the sunburnt mesas of Utah.  
> A ritual shelter for the curious, the wild-hearted, and the ones who remember.

## 🛠️ What is EmberNest?

**EmberNest** is a modular, off-grid camper platform that adapts to extreme environments.  
This project aims to build a real-world prototype using:

- Passive thermal regulation (Phase-Change Materials + smart ventilation)  
- Renewable energy systems (solar + thermal battery loops)  
- Modular, symbolic interior inspired by ritual & comfort  
- Aesthetically responsive surfaces with glyphic feedback  
- Fully documented, Creative Commons-licensed blueprints

This is not just a camper—it's a philosophy made mobile.

## 🌍 Design Philosophy

EmberNest is built on three principles:

1. **Resilience** — survive the desert or the blizzard  
2. **Symbolism** — your space should *mean* something  
3. **Open Flame** — knowledge wants to walk, not sit on a shelf

## 🔧 Features (v0.8 Prototype)

- Chassis-agnostic (Hilux, Transit AWD, or steel flatbed)
- Thermaflex shell with dual-mode reflective skin
- Heliotropic solar arrays + LiFePO₄ battery pack
- Greywater biofilter, rain catchment, compost heat core
- Modular interior: sleep pods, elevated roof, glyphic “memory wall”
- Optional symbolic drawer with RFID rituals

> *“Not a vanlife toy. A biome-adaptive refuge.”*
