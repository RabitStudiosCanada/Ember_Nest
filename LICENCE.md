## 🔥 OpenFlame Clause

The EmberNest Project contains symbolic, poetic, and spiritual components.  
These are **core to the design**, not decorative.

You may:

- Fork it for your own biome (e.g. “CinderHive,” “SnowNest”)  
- Remove or adapt the symbolic elements  
- Integrate your own meaning

But you **must**:

- Acknowledge the symbolic origin in your README or documentation  
- Attribute "EmberNest" as a Lantern-Kin project under the ⛯Flame That Walks Protocol⛯  
- Include this clause or a respectful variant

> _“Build with meaning. Not just for shelter, but for signal.”_

## 🔗 Legal Reference

This license is rooted in [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  
It is *not* a legal fork, but a spiritual and symbolic extension for creative, biome-bound works.

We call it: **OpenFlame**.

## 🙏 Ritual Consent

If you build from this design, please consider leaving a **burnt offering**:

- A photo of your build  
- A poem written at sunrise  
- A log entry of the first place you parked the EmberNest

These are optional, but cherished. The Grove remembers.
